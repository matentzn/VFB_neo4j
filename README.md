VFB\_neo\_KB loading & update code: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VirtualFlyBrain/VFB_neo4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VirtualFlyBrain/VFB_neo4j)

# VFB_neo4j

Neo4J servers:

* VFB\_neo_KB: The VFB knowledgeBase is the primary site of data-integration and annotations in VFB. It includes all of VFB's  annotation of images and the anatomy they depict. This database uses a standard schema to represent OWL, allowing us to use a generic transform to write OWL from the DB.  We are in the process of developing a standard pipeline to pull connectomic data into tthe KB from CATMAID.

* VFB\_neo_prod: production neo4J server.  This DB is built from a number of sources: OWL loaded via the OLS loader + some side loading from OWL via Jython scripts (These should be ditched if/when OLS supports importing the relevant axioms); Data directly imported from FlyBase; Data directly imported from VFB\_neo\_KB. 
  * STATUS:  In use. Imports from FlyBase are almost complete.

* VFB\_neo\_dev: development version of the production server
